Purpose
Audit elements collected should enable an auditor to clearly understand - and verify on existing golden records - all steps related to the golden record life cycle:

The acquisition of data involved in the golden record production, i.e.:
The list of primary sources involved in the golden record production
The transformation applied on source data before golden record production or update
The golden records production rules, i.e.:
The matching rules applied
The survival rules applied
The manual override
The retention policy
The deletion policy
We distinguish two types of elements to produce:

Specifications, which detail elements deployed and the design of the solution
Evidences collected during execution of the different steps of golden data life cycle
Specifications to produce
As for any project, It is expected to have the set of documentation detailing:

The security and architecture diagram, involving all primary sources and technical components used to transport and transform data, and including data transfer protocols.
The data dictionaries of the applicative systems involved in the golden records life cycle management. The data dictionaries must comply with Group Data Office requirements (see specific paragraph below).
The mapping between the applicative data dictionaries and the IT Asset Dictionary
Installation and Operation files for technical components of the Data Cleansing System
All rules applied to manage the golden record life cycle, detailing at least:
The identification of primary sources used to produce golden records
The transformation applied on primary sources
The matching rules
The survival rules
The access right management for manual override, describing enrollment workflow and segregation access on content.
The retention and deletion policies
Applicative data dictionary format
Group Data Office defines the following structure:

Attribute

Definition

Identifier

Unique identifier of the data within the application dictionary.

Application data name

Unique functional designation of the data

Definition

Definition of application data

Entity to which you belong

Specifies the connecting entity within the Data Model.

Business ID

Identifier of the business data(s) corresponding to the application data (information declined from the business dictionary)

Name of the business data

Designation of the business data(s) corresponding to the application data (information declined from the business dictionary)

Level of intrinsic confidentiality

Level of intrinsic confidentiality of the business data (information declined from the business dictionary)

Personal data

Personal data (Yes / No) (information declined from the business dictionary)

Application ID

Identifier of the application where the data is stored

Application label

Application Name

Data feeding mode

Data feeding mode in the application:

- Import: in case the application retrieves this data from another application

- Mixed: in case the application retrieves this data from another application or the one created in the application

- Create: in the case where the application produces the data

Data Source Application ID

ID of the source application(s) to be entered if the power mode is "Import" or "Mixed"

Name of the Data Source Application

Name of the source application(s) to be filled in if the power mode is "Import" or "Mixed"

Source Application Data ID

Identifier of the source data(s) to be entered if the power mode is "Import" or "Mixed"

Name of the source application data

Name of source(s) to be filled in if the power mode is "Import" or "Mixed"

For initialization:

"Business ID" is valued with the concatenation of "Business Object" and "Business Attribute".
For instance the identifier of the Server's Asset Group Id is : [Server].[AssetGroupId].
As the personal data attribute exists in the IT Asset Dictonary, it is not compulsary to managed it in the application data dictionary
Evidences
Evidences differ from specifications, as they should result, depending of the audited activity, from reverse engineering or functions embedded in the processing activity.

This paragraph presents:

The evidences to be collected during the different steps of processing of golden data
The expected collect methods, in order of preferred method
The expected publication methods, in order of preferred method
All activities	Catch trigger, timestamp and result of any execution step	
The execution Datetime
The trigger of the step (schedulling, event, manual,...)
The status of the step (success, error, warning,...)
Code and/or message when the status is error or warning
Automatic	
A self service interface
A request fulfilled with existing functionalities
A request fulfilled with additional development
Data acquisition	
Enable the understanding of the lineage of data collect

(reverse engineering of the implementation)

Identification of data sources
Data transformations applied:
the source data involved in the transformation
the target data storing the result of the transformation
data transformation rules or formulas
An harvesting solution connected to the data acquisition solution
A generic functionality embedded in the data acquisition solution (same ranking as #1 method)
A specific code integrated in the data acquisition code
A self service interface
A request fulfilled with existing functionalities
A request fulfilled with additional development
Golden record valuation	
Enable the understanding and the verification (with a redo method) of any golden record valuation.

(record by record traceability)

The primary sources rows involved in the production of a golden record
The matching rules applied
The survival rules applied
The enrichment applied
The cross referencing between primary sources rows identifiers and golden record identifier
A generic functionality executed during the golden record production process
A specific code integrated within the golden record production code
A self service interface
